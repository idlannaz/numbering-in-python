# Python Basic

## Overview

This is a simple Python script that performs multiple operations based on user input. It includes functionality to check if a number is even or odd, generate a multiplication table for a given number, determine the largest of three input numbers, and count the number of vowels in a user-provided string.

## Features

1. **Even or Odd Check**: Determines whether the input number is even or odd.
2. **Multiplication Table**: Generates and prints the multiplication table for a given number from 1 to 10.
3. **Largest Number Finder**: Accepts three numbers and prints the largest one.
4. **Vowel Counter**: Counts and prints the number of vowels in a user-provided string.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-multi-function-script.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd python-multi-function-script
   ```
3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

### Even or Odd Check

1. The script will prompt you to enter a number.
2. It will check if the number is even or odd and print the result.

Example:
```
Enter a number: 5
The number 5 is odd.
```

### Multiplication Table

1. After checking the number for even/odd, the script generates and prints the multiplication table for the number from 1 to 10.

Example:
```
Multiplication Table of 5
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 10 = 50
```

### Find the Largest Number

1. The script will prompt you to enter three numbers.
2. It will compare the three numbers and print the largest one.

Example:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 15
Enter the third number: 5
The largest number is 15
```

### Vowel Counter

1. The script will prompt you to input a string.
2. It will count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string and display the result.

Example:
```
Enter a string: Hello World
The number of vowels in Hello World is 3
```
